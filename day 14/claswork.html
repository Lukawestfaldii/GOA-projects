          <strong>Computer programming</strong> or <strong>coding</strong> is
          the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that
          computers can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and
          implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by
          writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers
          typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily
          intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed
          by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually
          requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge
          of the application domain, details of programming languages and
          generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

          Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete
          tasks. Programming languages provide the rules for building websites,
          apps, and other computer-based technologies. Each programming language
          helps humans accurately communicate with machines, Coding tells a

          The first programming language was developed in 1883 when Ada Lovelace
          and Charles Babbage worked together on the Analytical Engine, which
          was a primitive mechanical computer. <strong>ALSO</strong> The history
          of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical
          computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming
          languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation
          and similarly obscure syntax.[1] Throughout the 20th century, research
          in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming
          languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate
          instructions.The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül,
          created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945.[2] The first high-level
          language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in
          1951, for his PhD thesis.[3] The first commercially available language
          was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual
          appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John
          Backus at IBM.
